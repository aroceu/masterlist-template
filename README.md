# A fanfiction masterlist template
For fanfic writers to list their stories on a raw HTML/CSS webpage.

To preview, and for further documentation, see the webpage live at https://kingdra.net/fan/masterlist

## Additional notes

I do not plan on upgrading this code with new features or support beyond fixing thing per bugs/reports (total: 0 so far! yay!) and copyediting. Otherwise, this template code should be functional until the heat death of the universe. 

If, for some reason, I have made a change that upgrades the template, the change will appear in a more recent [commit](https://github.com/aroceu/masterlist-template/commits/main/) in the specific file and highlighting only the changed lines. 

You can style your AO3 fic pages with [ao3css](https://github.com/aroceu/ao3css), which I also made :)
