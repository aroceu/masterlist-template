# A fanfiction masterlist template
For fanfic writers to list their stories on a raw HTML/CSS webpage.

To preview, and for further documentation, see the webpage live at https://kingdra.net/fan/masterlist

## How to update

If you're new to Github or don't know how to check updates, take a peek at the [commits](https://github.com/aroceu/masterlist-template/commits/main/) and see what specifically was changed with each update (commit). 

If you've already downloaded/customized your own webpage before any more recent commits (though this is unlikely), instead of downloading my files again and resetting your own changes, you can look at the details of each commit and manually make the same modifications I made to your own, if you want. 

Fixes will NOT be frequent after initial launch, I promise. The template code should be functional until the heat death of the universe. The first 24 hours after launch are just me doing a lot of troubleshooting and being indecisive about things no one else cares about &hearts;
