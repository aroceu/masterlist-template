# A fanfiction masterlist template
For fanfic writers to list their stories on a raw HTML/CSS webpage.

To preview, and for further documentation, see the webpage live at https://kingdra.net/masterlist-template

## How to update

If you're new to Github or don't know how to check on changes, take a peek at the [commits](https://github.com/aroceu/masterlist-template/commits/main/) and see what specifically was changed with each update. 

If you've already downloaded/customized your own webpage, instead of downloading my files again and resetting your own changes, you can instead look at each commit details and manually make the same modifications I made to your own, if you want. Fixes will NOT be frequent after initial launch, I promise. The first 24 hours are me doing a lot of troubleshooting and being indecisive (lol).
